# ============================================================================
# Brief Introduction to R and Data Visualization
# ============================================================================

# PART 1: QUICK R BASICS
# ============================================================================

# R as a calculator

# Variables and assignment

# Vectors (collections of values)

# Basic functions

# Data types

# Quick peek at data frames (like Excel tables)

# PART 2: LOADING LIBRARIES
# ============================================================================

# Install packages (run once - commented out for class)

# Load essential libraries for data visualization
# Contains our dataset
# Data manipulation
# Data visualization
# For favstats function

# Check what we loaded

# PART 3: EXPLORING THE GAPMINDER DATASET
# ============================================================================

# What is gapminder?
# It contains data about countries' life expectancy, population, and GDP
# from 1952 to 2007, collected by Hans Rosling's Gapminder Foundation

# First look at the data
# First 6 rows
# Last 6 rows
# Structure overview

# Basic information about the dataset
# Number of rows
# Number of columns  
# Column names
# Dimensions (rows, columns)

# Summary statistics
# Basic summary for all variables
# Using favstats for detailed statistics on specific variables
# Life expectancy statistics
# GDP per capita statistics
# Population statistics
# Statistics by group (e.g., by continent)

# Explore the variables
# What continents?
# How many countries?
# What years?

# Quick data exploration with dplyr
# Most recent year
# Sort by life expectancy
# Top 10 countries

# Countries with lowest life expectancy in 2007

# Average life expectancy by continent in 2007

# BONUS: Quick visualization preview
# ============================================================================

# Simple scatter plot: GDP vs Life Expectancy

# With colors by continent

# Now you're ready to:
# 1. Create more complex visualizations with ggplot2
# 2. Explore data manipulation with dplyr
# 3. Make interactive plots
# 4. Build dashboards
# 5. Analyze trends over time
