# ========================================
# 1. AESTHETIC MAPPING
# ========================================

# Basic aesthetic mapping - outside as component
ggplot(data = bikes) +
  aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired)

# Different ways to specify aesthetics:

# Inside, explicit matching
ggplot(data = bikes, 
       mapping = aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired))

# Inside, implicit matching
ggplot(bikes, 
       aes(mean_temp, bikes_hired))

# Inside, mixed matching
ggplot(bikes, 
       aes(y = bikes_hired, x = mean_temp))

# ========================================
# 2. GEOMETRIES
# ========================================

# Add points geometry
ggplot(bikes, 
       aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired)) +
  geom_point()

# ========================================
# 3. VISUAL PROPERTIES OF LAYERS 
# ========================================

# Customize point appearance
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired)) +
  geom_point(
    colour = "#5989e3",  # colour as a HEX code
    alpha = .25,
    shape = "X",
    stroke = 1,
    size = 4
  )

# ========================================
# 4. SETTING VS MAPPING
# ========================================

# Setting a constant colour
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired)) +
  geom_point(
    colour = "#5989e3",
    alpha = .25
  )

# Mapping colour to a variable
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(colour = season_name),
    alpha = .25
  )

# ========================================
# 5. MAPPING EXPRESSIONS 
# ========================================

# Map colour to a logical expression
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(colour = mean_temp > 20),
    alpha = .25
  )

# ========================================
# 6. SETTING A CONSTANT PROPERTY
# ========================================

# Complex example with multiple aesthetics
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x = date, y = bikes_hired)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(colour = precipitation > 0,
        size = bikes_hired),
    shape = 23,
    colour = "black",  # This overrides the aesthetic mapping
    alpha = .25
  )

# ========================================
# 7. LOCAL VS GLOBAL ENCODING
# ========================================

# Local encoding (aesthetic in geom layer)
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(colour = season_name),
    alpha = .25
  )

# Global encoding (aesthetic in ggplot call)
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired,
           colour = season_name)) +
  geom_point(
    alpha = .25
  )

# ========================================
# 8. GLOBAL COLOUR AESTHETIC
# ========================================

# Global colour affects multiple geoms
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired,
           colour = season_name)) +
  geom_point(
    alpha = .25
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    se = FALSE
  )

# ========================================
# 9. OVERWRITE GLOBAL AESTHETICS
# ========================================

# Override global colour in one layer
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired,
           colour = season_name,
           group = season_name)) +
  geom_point(
    alpha = .25
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    se = FALSE,
    colour = "black"  # Overrides the global colour
  )

# ========================================
# 10. STORE GGPLOT AS OBJECT
# ========================================

# Create a base graph object
base_graph <-
  ggplot(bikes,
         aes(x = mean_temp, y = bikes_hired,
             colour = season_name,
             group = season_name)) +
  geom_point(
    alpha = .25
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    se = FALSE
  )

# Check the class
class(base_graph)

# Display the graph
base_graph

# ========================================
# 11. EXTEND GGPLOT OBJECT: ADD LABELS
# ========================================

# Add comprehensive labels
base_graph +
  labs(
    title = "TfL bike sharing trends",
    subtitle = "Reported bike rents versus temperature in London",
    x = "Mean temperature (Â°C)",
    y = "Total bike rentals",
    caption = "Data: TfL",
    colour = "Season:"
  )

# ========================================
# 12. EXTEND GGPLOT OBJECT: THEMES
# ========================================

# Apply different themes
base_graph + theme_light()

base_graph + theme_minimal()

# ========================================
# 13. USE PRE-DEFINED THEMES FROM {ggthemes}
# ========================================

# Uncomment these lines if you have ggthemes installed
# library(ggthemes)
base_graph + theme_economist()
base_graph + theme_solarized()

# ========================================
# 14. SET A THEME GLOBALLY
# ========================================

# Set a global theme for all subsequent plots
theme_set(theme_light(base_size = 18))

# Now base_graph will use the global theme
base_graph

# Reset to default theme (optional)
theme_set(theme_gray())

base_graph


# ========================================
# 15. HISTOGRAMS
# ========================================
#basic
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x=bikes_hired)) +
  geom_histogram()

#colors with minimal theme
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x=bikes_hired, fill=season_name)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal()



# ========================================
# 16. FACETING WITH facet_wrap()
# ========================================
# multiple graphs
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x=bikes_hired, fill=season_name)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap((~season_name)) +
  theme_minimal()

# month 
ggplot(bikes,
       aes(x=bikes_hired, fill=season_name)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap((~month)) +
  theme_minimal()
